        <p>
            I am an undergraduate student  at the University of California, Berkeley studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science. 
            I am jointly a part of the Cognition and Action Lab (Berkeley) and Physical Intelligence Lab (CMU) where I am advised by Richard Ivry and Jonathan Tsay. 
            I am an undergraduate student studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. 
            I am currently jointly a part of the 
            <a href="https://ivrylab.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cognition and Action Lab</a>  (Berkeley) and the 
            <a href="https://www.tsaylab.com/" target="_blank">Physical Intelligence Lab</a> (CMU),

            My current research is at the intersection between cognition and action, where I study how we develop cognitive strategies to help achieve our motor goals. 
            See a demo of the task I developed 
            <a href="https://hypothesis-testing-interactive.web.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            I recently had the opportunity to present my research at the 
            <a href="https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2024" target="_blank">Society for Neuroscience</a>
            conference this year in Chicago, IL. 
            See my abstract 
            <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/20433/presentation/16770" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <p>
            I am looking forward to beginning a PhD in cognitive neuroscience/psychology in Fall 2025. 
            My research interests include understanding how we reason, learn, and internally represent information. 
            I enjoy using psychophysical tasks and computational modeling, and, in the future, hope to incorporate neuroimaging techniques into my research.
