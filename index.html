        <p>
            I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science. 
            I am jointly a part of the
            <a href="https://ivrylab.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cognition and Action Lab</a>  (Berkeley) and the 
            <a href="https://www.tsaylab.com/" target="_blank">Physical Intelligence Lab</a> (CMU), 
            where I am advised by Richard Ivry and Jonathan Tsay. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am interested in pursuing a PhD in cognitive neuroscience/psychology after graduating. 
            My research interests include understanding how we reason, learn, and internally represent information. 
            I enjoy using psychophysical tasks and computational modeling to study this, but also hope to incorporate neuroimaging techniques into my future research.

                My current research is at the intersection between cognition and action, 
                where I study how we develop cognitive strategies to help achieve our motor goals. 

                Here is a
                <a href="https://hypothesis-testing-interactive.web.app/" target="_blank">demo</a> 
                of the task I developed to study this.

                I recently had the opportunity to present my research at the 
                <a href="https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2024" target="_blank">Society for Neuroscience</a>
                conference this year in Chicago, IL. 
                
                See my  
                <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/20433/presentation/16770" target="_blank">abstract</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jdalml4h02t3sb705udco/Niyogi_SfN_2024.pdf?rlkey=n54puflhi7p0e4s4i1gfo0iq6&e=1&st=ny6ttkp2&dl=0" target="_blank">poster</a>.
                
                I hope to extend this work to children, 
                individuals with neurological disorders (e.g., cerebellar degeneration), 
                and potentially non-human primates.
