        <p>
            I am an undergraduate student studying <strong>Cognitive Science</strong> and <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the University of California, Berkeley. 
            I am currently jointly a part of the 
            <a href="https://ivrylab.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cognition and Action Lab (Berkeley)</a> and the 
            <a href="https://www.tsaylab.com/" target="_blank">Physical Intelligence Lab (CMU)</a>, where I am advised by 
            <a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/richard-ivry" target="_blank">Richard Ivry</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/jonathan-tsay.html" target="_blank">Jonathan Tsay</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            My research focuses on the intersection of cognition and action, studying how we develop 
            cognitive strategies to help execute our motor goals. I recently had the opportunity to present my research at the 
            <a href="https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2024" target="_blank">Society for Neuroscience conference</a> this year in Chicago, IL. 
            <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/20433/presentation/16770" target="_blank">See my abstract here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I am looking forward to pursuing a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience/Psychology.
